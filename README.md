# arduino
Arduino projects, some of them are just playgrounds and some are real project.

## Project table
A real project I did for a DIY motorized sit-stand desk.
I added a motor to a desk I bought from Ikea.
This project has two versions; one with a joystick as a controller and another with two buttons and an ultrasonic distance sensor (this is the one I'm curretnly using).
